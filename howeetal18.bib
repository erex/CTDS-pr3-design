abstract = {Summary Reliable estimates of animal density and abundance are essential for effective wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling (DS) is a widely used framework for estimating animal abundance. DS models assume that observations of distances to animals are independent. Non-independent observations introduce overdispersion, causing model selection criteria such as AIC or AICc to favour overly complex models, with adverse effects on accuracy and precision. We describe, and evaluate via simulation and with real data, estimators of an overdispersion factor (), and associated adjusted model selection criteria (QAIC) for use with overdispersed DS data. In other contexts, a single value of is calculated from the ``global'' model, that is the most highly parameterised model in the candidate set, and used to calculate QAIC for all models in the set; the resulting QAIC values, and associated {$\Delta$}QAIC values and QAIC weights, are comparable across the entire set. Candidate models of the DS detection function include models with different general forms (e.g. half-normal, hazard rate, uniform), so it may not be possible to identify a single global model. We therefore propose a two-step model selection procedure by which QAIC is used to select among models with the same general form, and then a goodness-of-fit statistic is used to select among models with different forms. A drawback of this approach is that QAIC values are not comparable across all models in the candidate set. Relative to AIC, QAIC and the two-step model selection procedure avoided overfitting and improved the accuracy and precision of densities estimated from simulated data. When applied to six real datasets, adjusted criteria and procedures selected either the same model as AIC or a model that yielded a more accurate density estimate in five cases, and a model that yielded a less accurate estimate in one case. Many DS surveys yield overdispersed data, including cue counting surveys of songbirds and cetaceans, surveys of social species including primates, and camera-trapping surveys. Methods that adjust for overdispersion during the model selection stage of DS analyses therefore address a conspicuous gap in the DS analytical framework as applied to species of conservation concern.},

  abstract = {With animal species disappearing at unprecedented rates, we need an efficient monitoring method providing reliable estimates of population density and abundance, critical for the assessment of population status and trend. We deployed 160 camera traps (CTs) systematically over 743 locations covering 17,127 km2 of evergreen lowland rainforest of Salonga National Park, block South, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We evaluated the applicability of CT distance sampling (CTDS) to species different in size and behaviour. To improve precision of estimates, we evaluated two methods estimating species' availability (`A') for detection by CTs. We recorded 16,700 video clips, revealing 43 different animal taxa. We estimated densities of 14 species differing in physical, behavioural and ecological traits, and extracted species-specific availability from available video footage using two methods (a) `ACa' (Cappelle et al. [2019] Am. J. Primatol., 81, e22962) and (b) `ARo' (Rowcliffe et al. [2014] Methods Ecol. Evol. 5, 1170). With sample sizes being large enough, we found minor differences between ACa and ARo in estimated densities. In contrast, low detectability and reactivity to the camera were main sources of bias. CTDS proved efficient for estimating density of homogenously rather than patchily distributed species. Synthesis and applications. Our application of camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) to a diverse vertebrate community demonstrates the enormous potential of this methodology for surveys of terrestrial wildlife, allowing rapid assessments of species' status and trends that can translate into effective conservation strategies. By providing the first estimates of understudied species such as the Congo peafowl, the giant ground pangolin and the cusimanses, CTDS may be used as a tool to revise these species' conservation status in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Based on the constraints we encountered, we identify improvements to the current application, enhancing the general applicability of this method.},

  abstract = {Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},

  abstract = {Effective monitoring methods are needed for assessing the state of biodiversity and detecting population trends. The popularity of camera trapping in wildlife surveys continues to increase as they are able to detect species in remote and difficult-to-access areas. As a result, several statistical estimators of the abundance of unmarked animal populations have been developed, but none have been widely tested. Even where the potential for accurate estimation has been demonstrated, whether these methods estimators can yield estimates of sufficient precision to detect trends and inform conservation action remains questionable. Here, we assess the effort–precision relationship of camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) in order to help researchers design efficient surveys. A total of 200 cameras were deployed for 10 months across 200 km2 in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We estimated abundance of Maxwell's duikers, western chimpanzees, leopards, and forest elephants that are challenging to enumerate due to rarity or semi-arboreality. To test the effects of spatial and temporal survey effort on the precision of CTDS estimates, we calculated coefficient of variation (CV) of the encounter rate from subsets of our complete data sets. Estimated abundance of leopard and Maxwell's duiker density (20\% {$<$} CV {$<$} 30\% and CV = 11\%, respectively) were similar to prior estimates from the same area. Abundances of chimpanzees (20\% {$<$} CV {$<$} 30\%) were underestimated, but the quality of inference was similar to that reported after labor-intensive line transect surveys to nests. Estimates for the rare forest elephants were potentially unreliable since they were too imprecise (60\% {$<$} CV {$<$} 200\%). Generalized linear models coefficients indicated that for relatively common, ground-dwelling species, CVs between 10\% and 20\% are achievable from a variety of survey designs, including long-term (6+ months) surveys at few locations (50), or short term (2-week to 2-month) surveys at 100–150 locations. We conclude that CTDS can efficiently provide estimates of abundance of multiple species of sufficient quality and precision to inform conservation decisions. However, estimates for the rarest species will be imprecise even from ambitious surveys and may be biased for species that exhibit strong reactions to cameras.},

  abstract = {Effective wildlife management requires information on population status and distribution. Survey methods that provide estimates of these population parameters can vary greatly in effort required, area covered, precision of estimates, and cost. Trade-offs are required, because increasing precision and area coverage generally requires increasing field effort and incurs a higher cost. We compare DNA- and camera trap based-spatial capture-recapture approaches (DNA-SCR and CT-SCR) to the widely-used, dung-based line transect distance sampling (LTDS) method to assess their performance when applied to three relatively large populations of forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis ({$>$}500 individuals), in order to evaluate their feasibility for future use at national and regional scales. Six of the nine surveys had a coefficient of variation below 20\%; area coverage via DNA-SCR and LTDS was comparable and greatly exceeded that of the CT-SCR as applied; overall cost was highest for the LTDS surveys compared to the other two methods. We designed a new metric with which to compare survey methods: an integrated feasibility index (IFI). This combines three typical survey components: total area covered, level of precision achieved, and cost. The IFI suggests that DNA-SCR and LTDS are equally acceptable in terms of the combination of the three survey components, and that either survey method is suitable for large (national or regional) spatial scales for forest elephant density estimation. CT-SCR provides more precise estimates, but has double the IFI, due to the high cost per km2. DNA-SCR in particular, given the improvements highlighted in this study, is now being used at a national scale in Gabon. In conclusion, we recommend that the use of these spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, and their development, continue. Future findings and improvements should be compiled across studies to ensure their robust evolution as an option for monitoring the African forest elephant across its range and inform strategies and action for its conservation.},
